I built an animatronic for use in an old shooting gallery.

When I was studying in at 24 Juin in Sherbrooke, a classmate asked me to help him build an animatronic like the ones in old timey shooting gallery and naturally I said yes. Over the course of the next few weeks we built what looked like a ducktape monster.

We blew two arduino megas in the process, turns out they dont like powering stalled servos...

The final prototype all dressed up looked like this:

Here is a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=fApZLNiPXt8) where you can watch it move.

We were happy that it was working but it was still a sad sight.
